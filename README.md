# 🎬 Mobile Movie App

This is my **first React Native application**, built using **Expo**.  
I created this project while learning React Native **by myself**, focusing on understanding core concepts like navigation, layouts, and responsive UI.

The app is a **Movie App** where users can browse movies and view movie details.
